I am an associate professor of politics at the University of Kriens. I specialise in *party* politics. My work has featured in leading media outlets as well as in academic journals.

Before joining the University of Kriens, I was an assistant professor at the University of Emmen, and a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Meggen.
